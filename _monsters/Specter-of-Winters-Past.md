description: |
  A Specter of Winters Past is the angry, unfettered spirit of a humanoid that has been prevented from passing to the afterlife. These specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.

  #### Beyond Redemption
  When a ghost's unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits the Specter of Winters Past. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.

  #### Undying Hatred
  Living creatures remind these specters that life is beyond their grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.

  #### Winter Past
  A Specter of Winters Past is a remnant of a humanoid that met its untimely end during winter and was prevented from passing on into the afterlife. It is doomed to haunt the place of its death during the winter months.

  #### Combat Tactics
  The Specter of Winters Past starts combat with its Candle Extinguisher affixed to its head, summoning its spectral helpers on the first turn. On its second turn, it removes the Candle Extinguisher, hoping to blind nearby foes, then uses its Memory Twist ability to target as many enemies as possible so its helpers can overwhelm the stunned. It remains in melee range, using its Blinding Candle and Candle Extinguisher attacks to pummel enemies while disorienting them.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Blinding Candle.*** While the Specter of Winters Past has its Candle Extinguisher removed, a blinding beam of light radiates from its head in a 5-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the Specter and can see the beam must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.  
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The Specter of Winters Past can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.  
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Specter of Winters Past makes two Candle Extinguisher attacks.  
>
> ***Candle Extinguisher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) fire damage. The Specter removes the Candle Extinguisher from its head to make this attack.  
>
> ***Spectral Helpers (1/7 Days).*** The Specter magically summons 2d4 winter spirits to appear within 60 feet of it. These spirits use the statistics of a **specter** and act on their own initiative. They remain for 1 minute, until the Specter dies, or until it dismisses them as a bonus action.  
>
> ***Memory Twist (Recharge 5–6).*** The Specter magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot line. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (5d8) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
