description: |
  A **Silent Knight** is a holy warrior, originally created by the dwarven god **Dumathoin** and charged with the collection of secrets. Once a Silent Knight learns a secret, no amount of magic or persuasion can force it to speak. Its core ability is the **Aura of Silence**, which disrupts nearby spellcasters and ensures that when a victim is bested, no one will hear them scream.
  
  Though some may forget their original purpose, they can be swayed by secrets or gemstones to assist creatures, as long as it doesn't threaten them or their creator. They hold a unique respect for dwarves, to whom they are a **Friend to Dwarves** and will never willingly attack.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Silent Knight excels at disrupting spellcasters by engulfing them in its **Aura of Silence** or by hitting them with its **Longsword** to prevent them from speaking. With a high **Armor Class**, **Martial Champion** trait (crits on 19 or 20), and **Multiattack** (3 attacks), it is a serious threat to front-line warriors as well. It may use its **Action Surge** to maximize attacks in a single turn. When dealing with a ranged or fleeing opponent, it can use its **Dagger** attacks.
