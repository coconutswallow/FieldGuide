description: |
  **The Nutcrackers** are small, deceptively durable constructs created by fey and most often seen during the winter, hung as Midwinter ornaments. They are blessed with life by a fey, and their alignment and purpose (protector or menace) depend on their creator. They are known for their high dexterity, dancing skill, and an irrational, all-consuming hatred for small rodents. Even the most evil Nutcracker is unable to inflict serious harm upon children.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  A Nutcracker uses its **False Appearance** to ambush enemies. Once combat begins, it typically uses its innate magic to cast ***Otto's irresistible dance***, then closes the distance to attack with its **Rapier** and summon its **Spiritual Weapon** (which appears as a giant slipper) on the following turn. A key vulnerability is its **Slayer of mice** compulsion: if a small rodent is present, the Nutcracker will drop everything to attack it, becoming the sole focus of its attention.
