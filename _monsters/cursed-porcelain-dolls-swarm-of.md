> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the swarm remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a set of ordinary dolls.
>
> ***Fear Aura.*** Any creature hostile to the swarm that starts its turn within 10 feet of the swarm must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is **frightened** until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the swarm's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Small construct. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +3, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 20 ($8d4$) Slashing damage, or 10 ($4d4$) Slashing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** until the end of the doll swarm's next turn.
