description: |
  **Deadeyes** are made from the souls of mortals claimed by devils. A devil imbues the soul into a corpse in the Material Plane, assigning it a bountyâ€”a mortal who cheated the devil out of a contract. The deadeye reclaims its mortal body, superficially resembling a zombie, but its sockets burn with hellfire that flares brightly in the presence of its target. The bounty always recognizes that the deadeye has been sent to slay it.
  
  The deadeye has six months, six days, and six hours to slay its bounty, and it is armed with a six-chambered **Hellfire Pistol** that can send its bounty straight to the Nine Hells. If the bounty is killed, or if the deadeye fails to kill its bounty before its time runs out, the deadeye's soul returns to the devil that owns it. If the bounty is too powerful, a devil often sends multiple deadeyes.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Deadeye is a deadly ranged combatant who uses its high Initiative (thanks to **Quickdraw**) and **Tumble** to constantly maneuver for the perfect shot. It relies on **Evasion** and **Undead Fortitude** to shrug off area damage and survive fatal blows. The Deadeye begins combat by using **Faceoff** to target multiple foes immediately. Thanks to **Gunslinger**, it can engage in melee or at long range without disadvantage, making it a relentless hunter that ignores common cover.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Bounty Hunter.*** The deadeye has advantage on Wisdom checks to track its bounty.
>
> ***Evasion.*** If the deadeye is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the deadeye instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
>
> ***Gunslinger.*** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on the deadeye's ranged attack rolls with a pistol. In addition, the deadeye ignores half cover and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks with a pistol.
>
> ***Quickdraw.*** The deadeye adds its Wisdom modifier to its initiative rolls (included in the Initiative score above).
>
> ***Tumble.*** The deadeye can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on its turns.
>
> ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the deadeye to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the deadeye drops to 1 hit point instead.
>
> ***Undead Nature.*** A deadeye doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The deadeye makes three ranged attacks with its Hellfire Pistol.
>
> ***Hellfire Pistol.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +6, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 ($1d10 + 3$) Piercing damage plus 7 ($2d6$) Fire damage (Total 15 damage). If this damage kills the deadeye's bounty, its soul is funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.
>
> ***Faceoff (Recharge 6).*** The deadeye makes a ranged attack on up to six different targets it can see within 90 feet of it, making a separate attack roll for each target.
