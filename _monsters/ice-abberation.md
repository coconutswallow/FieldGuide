description: |
  The Ice Aberration is a terrifying creature from the frozen depths of the Elemental Plane of Ice. Its crystalline form pulses with cold energy, and frost forms on every surface it touches.
  
  #### Habitat
  Ice Aberrations are typically found in arctic regions, deep ice caves, or areas where the boundary between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Ice has worn thin.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  These creatures prefer to use tsheir Chill Aura to weaken opponents before closing in with their devastating Lash attacks. They're cunning enough to use their Frozen Restraint ability to control the battlefield.
