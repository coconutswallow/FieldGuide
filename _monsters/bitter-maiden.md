description: |
  The **Bitter Maiden** is a mournful undead spirit, the remnant of a person whose melancholy and grief caused them to return to the living world after their death. They often take the form of their living self, but wear a **white porcelain mask** decorated with funerary offerings to hide the hideous, decaying husk underneath.
  
  These spirits are **predators in winter**, driven by a desperate need for warmth in death. They hunt lonely souls, especially those who have experienced emotional loss or are traveling alone during a cold storm. If the mask is removed, the maiden loses its composure and its defensive benefits, flying into a jealous rage to reclaim it.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  A Bitter Maiden will **stalk** its prey, using its **Aura of Bitter Winter** to heavily obscure the area (while it can see normally) before striking.
  
  1.  On its first turn, it uses **Bitter Hoarfrost** for massive cold damage and to impose disadvantage on ability checks.
  2.  It then uses its bonus action to activate its **Aura of Bitter Winter** to obscure the area.
  3.  It focuses its **Multiattack** on vulnerable, "squishy" targets, using **Icy Glare** to **Paralyze** the target, followed by a **Life Drain** attack to reduce the victim's hit point maximum.
  4.  The Maiden takes advantage of the **frightened** condition imposed by *Icy Glare* to discourage opponents from chasing it.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aura of Bitter Winter.*** The maiden can activate or deactivate this feature as a bonus action. While active, the aura causes the area within 30 feet of the maiden to become **heavily obscured**. The maiden ignores this effect and can see normally.
>
> ***Mask of the Dead.*** The maiden wears a funerary mask upon its face to hide its undead nature. While the maiden is wearing the mask, it is immune to magic that would detect it as an undead creature. The mask can be removed with a contested Strength (Athletics) check. The maiden will lose all benefits this mask gives it upon taking it off.
>
> ***Mimicry (When Wearing the Mask of the Dead).*** The maiden can mimic the voice of a deceased creature it has taken the form of. A creature that hears the voice can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The maiden uses its **Icy Glare** and makes a **Life Drain** attack.
>
> ***Icy Glare.*** The maiden targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is **paralyzed** until the end of the maiden's next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is **frightened** of the maiden for 1 minute. The **frightened** target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the maiden, ending the **frightened** condition on itself on a success.
>
> ***Life Drain.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 ($2d8 + 3$) Necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> ***Bitter Hoarfrost (Recharge 5-6).*** The maiden throws out a spray of ice and freezing cold in a 30 foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 36 ($8d8$) Cold damage and have disadvantage on all ability checks until the end of the affected creature's turn.
