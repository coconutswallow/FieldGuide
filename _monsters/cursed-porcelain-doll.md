cr: 1
type: Small Construct, Chaotic Evil
category: Hawthorne Homebrew
description: |
  The Cursed Porcelain Doll is a deceptively fragile-looking toy animated by a malicious, chaotic spirit. It is a small, unnerving killer that seeks to terrify and incapacitate victims before destroying them.
  
  #### Habitat
  These dolls are often found in the homes of unwary collectors, toy shops, or abandoned manor houses. They gravitate toward places where they can remain motionless and appear harmless, waiting for a victim.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The doll uses its **False Appearance** to hide until the last moment. It initiates combat by attempting to use its **Terrifying Glare** to paralyze a single enemy, followed by **Claw** attacks to frighten and incapacitate others. Its vulnerability to **thunder** damage suggests a weakness to loud, concussive force.
