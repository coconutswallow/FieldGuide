description: |
  The Queen of Air and Darkness employs fey spirits of wind and snow to retrieve creatures or items from the Material Plane. These spirits are known as Wind Wraiths, Yule Men, or in the Sylvan tongue, Grimfrel.

  #### Making a List
  If one finds themselves pursued by a Grimfrel, every step it takes brings it closer to its prey or the object of its charge. This charge is detailed on a piece of vellum made from the hide of an evil creature, written in magical script that only the Grimfrel can read. A creature with truesight can also read the list. If *dispel magic* is cast upon the list, it disappears for 1 minute before reappearing — often enraging the Grimfrel.

  #### Checking it Thrice
  Bound by the customs and geases of the Winter Court, a Grimfrel compulsively checks its list to ensure no new charge has been added or removed.

  #### It Knows if You’re Naughty or Nice
  In addition to seeking out its charge, the Grimfrel delights in flaying and eating “naughty” children — presumably to procure more material for its vellum lists.

  #### Combat Tactics
  Grimfrel are employed by the Queen of Air and Darkness to subdue and retrieve those that have earned the ire of the Unseelie Fey, whether it by offering insult, or breaking a fey bargain. The Grimfrel tracks its charge invisibly, attacking when the target least expects it. During an ambush, it first strikes with its claws and Frostbite to capitalize upon catching its target sleeping or otherwise unaware. After delivering vicious slashes, it uses its Frigid Visage to sap the creature's stamina, to prevent escape. When the prey begins to falter and stumble, it then freezes it solid with Winter's Grasp, in preparation for transport back to the lands of Winter in the Feywild. Once its charge is captured, it may choose to seek out any nearby humanoids, rewarding the nice with gifts, while flaying the naughty in their beds, sure to return to the lands of its Queen before the morning light.

>
> ***Icy Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage.  
>
> ***Frostbite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.  
> If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage at the start of each of its turns due to spreading frostbite. Each time the Grimfrel hits the wounded target with this attack, the cold damage increases by 1d10. A creature can tend to the frostbite with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or the frostbite ends if the target receives magical healing.  
>
> ***Frigid Visage.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the Grimfrel that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the Grimfrel remains in sight. On a success, one level of exhaustion imposed this way ends. A creature immune to this effect for 24 hours after succeeding.  
>
> ***Sense Guilt.*** The Grimfrel targets a creature it can see within 10 feet and magically perceives the creature’s emotional state. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or the Grimfrel also learns its alignment. On a success, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.  
>
> ***Winter’s Grasp (Recharge 4–6).*** Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a DC 15 C
