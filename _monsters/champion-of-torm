description: |
  A Champion of Torm is a holy warrior, a paragon of duty, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. Clad in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword infused with divine radiance, they stand as unwavering bulwarks against chaos and evil.
  
  #### Habitat
  Champions of Torm are found wherever the innocent are threatened or where duty calls. They often serve in temples, lead militias, or venture out into the world to uphold the tenets of their god.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Champion uses **Torm's Blessing** to deliver devastating radiant strikes with their greatsword. They rely on **Steadfast** to keep morale high and their **Spellcasting** to support allies with *Bless* and protect themselves with *Spirit Guardians*. Their **Parry** reaction makes them extremely difficult to defeat in melee.
