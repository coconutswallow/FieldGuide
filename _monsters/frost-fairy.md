description: |
  **Frost Fairies** are malicious and capricious fey, harbingers of winter who terrorize FaerÃ»n's inhabitants to remind them of the need for warmth and companionship. They are bound by a compact with the Queen of Air and Darkness that forbids them from permanent murder or maiming, but they use this rule capriciously.
  
  They typically appear as blue globes of light, pelting wanderers with freezing snowballs. Inside iron structures, they take the form of beautifully sculpted winged figurines made of ice. Prideful and vicious, they enjoy inducing terror but also crave veneration. They are permitted to defend themselves with lethal retribution, often by provoking victims into self-defense first.
  
  Defeating a Frost Fairy safely involves **bribery, flattery, and submission**. A considerably generous gift can even court their twisted sense of loyalty, though they are never true slaves.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  Frost Fairies are masters of harassment and provocation. They use their **Snowball** and cold spells (*frostbite, ray of frost*) to annoy and injure victims, aiming to bait them into attacking the fairy first. Once attacked, the fairy breaks the compact and retaliates with lethal force using its higher-level spells (*sleet storm, wall of ice, ice storm*) and **Ice-Sickle** attacks. They use their high speed and **Extraplanar Demise** trait to confidently engage, knowing that if defeated, they simply return to the Feywild.

## Variant: Frost Fairy Familiar

A Frost Fairy can enter into a compact to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing creature. While the fairy is within 10 feet of its bonded creature, the creature shares the fairy's **cold immunity** and **fire resistance**. The fairy can end its service as a familiar at any time on a whim, ending the telepathic bond.
