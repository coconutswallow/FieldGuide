description: |
  Frost Fairies are malicious and capricious fey that appear during winter to terrorize the inhabitants of Faerûn wherever frost and snow reach. Myth and legend claim that rather than be summoned by the coming of winter, they are harbingers thereof, given leave by their Queen to savage the world with ice to remind the people of Faerûn to be grateful for the warmth and companionship of friends.
  
  Stronger than their size gives them credit for, they entertain themselves by playing pranks and harassing travelers who have more bravery than sense to risk trekking out in the biting cold. A known menace to Faerûn, they appear as blue globes of light, pelting wanderers with storm of freezing snowballs and burying them in ice. Within the confines of a structure built with iron however, they appear as beautifully sculpted winged figurines made of ice. Prideful and vicious, they enjoy the terror and fear of mortals, but equally treasure veneration and supplication by those creatures. While forbidden from murder or maiming of mortals by the compact with the Queen of Air and Darkness that allows them free reign upon the material plane, Frost Fairies are allowed to defend themselves and kin with lethal retribution. As befits the capricious fey, this retribution might itself have been enabled by a victim's attempt to defend itself from the fairies' harassment.
  
  Defeating a frost fairy safely involves bribery, flattery, and submission. Offering the fairy gifts freely given with charming words can lead a Frost Fairy to leave its victims alone, though not without spiriting away its newly given tribute. In some cases, with a considerably generous gift, some Frost Fairies build an interest in a mortal beyond that of a victim, sometimes pledging themselves as a creature's ally or familiar. In these cases, the fairies practice a twisted sense of loyalty, upholding their companion's interests. But it's wise to remember that a Frost Fairy is never a slave, they act of their own volition, and take action to benefit their companion, sometimes in ways that are undesired.
  
  Nevertheless, it is not without hope. A Frost Fairy's friendship or help can be courted with gifts and flattery, and are often valued for their magical talents as familiars by wizards and other spellcasters. However, it is wise to always remember that a fey does as it wishes, and the nature of relationship is never that of a master and minion.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  Frost Fairies are beholden to the ancient compact that allows them to visit the material plane and wreak their havoc. While permitted to harass creatures, they're forbidden from mortal harm or permanent injury, though as expected from a fey the letter is followed if not the spirit. Frost Fairies are permitted to break this compact for the sole reason of defending themselves against harm, though the definition of harm can be as vague as the fairy intends it. Typically, this leads to Frost Fairies harassing or attacking their victims with vicious pranks. Pelting with frozen snowballs, causing them to slip, stealing belongings, all of it done to provoke a creature into defending itself so that that fairies may retaliate with force.

  #### Variant: Frost Fairy Familiar
  The Fairy can enter into a compact to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing creature. While the fairy is within 10 feet of its bonded creature, the creature shares the fairy's cold immunity and fire resistance. The fairy can end its service as a familiar at any time on a whim, ending the telepathic bond.
