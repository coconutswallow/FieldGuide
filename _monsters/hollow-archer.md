description: |
  A Hollow Archer is an undead warrior that retains the basic fighting skills it possessed in life, driven by a dull, relentless purpose to strike down the living. It appears as a gaunt figure in weathered armor, its eyesockets empty save for the faint glow of malevolent animation.
  
  #### Habitat
  Hollow Archers are typically found guarding important entryways, patrolling walls, or holding defensive positions in ruined fortresses and necromantic dungeons. They act as silent, tireless sentries for their dark masters.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Hollow Archer uses its **Shortbow** to engage targets from a distance, relying on its armor for protection. If cornered or out of ammunition, it draws its **Shortsword**. Like other Hollows, it possesses the dangerous **Flurry** action, which it will use to attempt to overwhelm a single adjacent target with a sudden, relentless barrage of four melee attacks.
