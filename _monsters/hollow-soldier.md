description: |
  A Hollow Soldier is a common undead infantryman, its husk clad in faded armor and driven by the lingering military discipline it held in life. Though slow-witted, it is capable of wielding multiple weapons and utilizing tactical gear, making it a more significant threat than a basic zombie.
  
  #### Habitat
  Hollow Soldiers are typically found in the ranks of undead armies, garrisoned in ruined castles, or standing sentry duty in the crypts and battlements they guarded in life. They are a staple of necromancer forces.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Hollow Soldier uses its **Longsword** and **Shield** to maintain a higher Armor Class and hold the line. It uses its **Spear** or **Light Crossbow** to engage targets trying to keep their distance. Like other Hollows, it possesses the dangerous **Flurry** action, which it will use to attempt to overwhelm a single adjacent target with a rapid barrage of four melee attacks.
