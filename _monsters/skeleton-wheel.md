description: |
  A grotesque fusion of undeath and mechanism, the Skeleton Wheel is the reanimated remains of a victim violently contorted and bound within a large wooden or metal wheel. Driven by a relentless, crushing evil, it patrols ancient roads and ruins, seeking to flatten any creature in its path.
  
  #### Habitat
  Skeleton Wheels are typically found in crypts, abandoned siege weapon depots, or guarding old, cursed roads and military fortifications. They are sometimes created by necromancers who specialize in macabre constructs.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Skeleton Wheel's strategy is simple: move as fast as possible in a straight line, aiming to run over and knock targets **prone** with its **Slam** attack, then immediately use **Devastating Roll** on subsequent turns to crush its helpless victims. It relies on its high mobility and continuous damage output to overwhelm unarmored or smaller foes.
