description: |
  Beings of ancient evil, wendigos haunt the minds of mortals, driving them to desperation and, ultimately, cannibalistic madness. They enjoy whittling down their prey before they strike, trailing victims for days, even weeks, while plaguing their journeys with nightmares and foul weather.
  
  **Uncaring Spirits**. Tribal humanoids sometimes worship wendigos as gods, bringing them live sacrifices or attempting to appease the creatures by engaging in ritual cannibalism. They mark a wendigo’s territory with fetishes and dress in the furs and hides of whatever animal it most closely resembles. Wendigos take little interest in the practices of their worshippers, and view them only as an ample supply of victims.
  
  **Opportunistic Hunters**. The warmth of a campfire and shelter from the cutting wind are little protection against some of the things that lurk in the dark, isolated places of the world, where sustenance is scarce and hospitality nonexistent. High passes, forlorn tundra, trackless primeval woodlands, it is within these desolate places that one is most likely to encounter a wendigo: an evil spirit that preys on explorers and hunters when resources are running low and true desperation is setting in.
  
  While the flesh-eating beasts of nature might simply assault unwary victims head-on, the wendigo is a horror that turns the hunter into the hunted, plaguing its prey with bone-chilling nightmares at night and hazy visions of cannibalism during the day. The horrid images brought on by a wendigo’s curse cause the victim to slowly lose its grasp on what is right and wrong, ultimately inspiring the cursed individual to succumb to its terrible hunger pangs and feast upon its own allies in a gory act of shameful cannibalism.

  **Mythological Creatures**. Wendigos are little known outside the myths of certain indigenous tribes of particularly isolated regions, far from the security and hospitality of cities. The lands of the wendigo are where folk struggle to survive on a daily basis with already meager supplies stretched thin, where a single turn of bad luck can mean the difference between survival and starvation. It is under these circumstances, when fortune has turned against a lone hunter, isolated homestead, or lost wagon train, that wendigo psychosis, the insanity-inducing curse that forces innocents to indulge in the basest acts in order to survive, most often rears its vile head and draws otherwise normal people into acts of horrific desperation in which they must feed upon their own kind in order to survive.
  
  **Cannibalistic Urges**. The cannibalistic act brought on by wendigo psychosis is the last stage of the curse, at which point the victim flees straight into the sky at an unearthly speed, its legs burning away into jagged stubs, and becomes fully inhabited by a wendigo spirit, the body now only a shell for the hungry beast. A wendigo’s curse is not the only means of this transformation, however, as in some cases individuals who dwell in highly civilized lands but still partake in eating their own kind’s flesh also find themselves making the metamorphosis into wendigos. In societies where cannibalism is not seen as a taboo, individuals rarely if ever become wendigos, and these cultures generally have no history of encounters with such monsters. Scholars speculate that wendigo spirits require the perpetrators of the cannibalistic acts to be as shocked and shamed by their own actions as their victims are.

  **Unearthly Horrors**. While wendigos are widely believed to come from somewhere outside the Material Plane, none can say where exactly these horrors originate. Their unworldly powers and animalistic appearances inspire some to believe that wendigos are actually fallen agathions from the Beastlands; such claims are quickly dismissed by scholars, though they themselves can offer only a few alternative origin theories.
  
  Most regard wendigos as spirits from the darkest reaches of the multiverse, much like devourers and other monsters of mysterious purpose. What appearance these disembodied spirits may possess while within this nether region is a mystery to most, as no one has ever documented seeing a wendigo spirit not already residing in a material host. Because of this elusiveness, many folk on the outskirts of civilization regard wendigos simply as manifestations of mortal corruption, disembodied ideas rather than actual creatures.
  
  **Possessive Spirit**. A wendigo spirit only possesses a living host after the creature has been afflicted with wendigo psychosis. This curse is typically brought about by another wendigo who has touched a victim’s dreams or has dragged the creature into the sky with it. Occasionally, a particularly unlucky individual may contract wendigo psychosis simply through unfortunate circumstance, when it must perform gruesome acts of cannibalism in order to survive. When a creature has been afflicted with wendigo psychosis, the spirit of a wendigo is attracted to the creature to await its final act of desperation: devouring the flesh of one of its own kind, usually a close friend or loved one.
  
  Once the victim falls to this level of madness, it makes its aerial sojourn through the sky, during which time its feet are burnt away into charred stumps from the speed of its passage, and the victim undergoes the full transformation into a wendigo; the original victim ceases to exist, its body mutilated and its soul sent to the afterlife, and the wendigo spirit inherits the body as a new husk with which it can interact with the material world.
  
  **Gruesome Transformation**. A victim who dies of wendigo psychosis can only be brought back to life with powerful restorative spells such as true resurrection or wish. Bringing a victim back to life in this way may restore the original creature, but the wendigo who exploited the psychotic individual yet remains in its weathered shell, which is only a pale reflection of the mortal body it once was.
  
  When a wendigo assumes the body of a mortal, it warps the tattered corpse into an imagined representative of its own twisted desires and horrid imaginings. The hands turn into bloodstained claws, the flesh grows a layer of matted fur, and the head transforms into that of a grotesque, rabid animal, typically a wild creature native to the area where the mortal died. Thus a wendigo only barely resembles the original mortal creature whose body it now inhabits, the beast having shed all of its personal relics and clothing in exchange for its feral, nightmarish visage.
  
  **Territorial Stalker**. Once a wendigo has manifested in physical form, it begins to stalk all who enter its territory, either consuming its prey to sate its own endless appetite or inflicting its transformative psychosis upon victims to spawn more of its kind. While wendigo spirits are definitely not of this world, in their material forms they are native to the Material Plane and thus must eat in order to survive.
  
  When intelligent prey is scarce, a wendigo will indulge in its bestial desires and hunt weaker animals to feed upon. A wendigo is constantly wracked with intense hunger pangs, manifestations of its ravenous greed that are only temporarily relieved by feasting on such creatures that know fear. It is for this reason that wendigos prefer to feed upon humanoids, magical beasts, and any other creatures that know to be afraid of the dark and shudder at the sound of howling winds.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aversion of Fire.*** If the wendigo takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The wendigo's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). The wendigo can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
> * **At will:** *wind walk*\*
> * **1/day each:** *control weather*, *dream* (nightmare only)
>
> \*The wendigo casts and transforms as an action. It can only target itself and up to one **grappled** creature, which is considered willing for the spell and becomes solid again if the grapple ends.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The wendigo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The wendigo regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the wendigo takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the wendigo's next turn. The wendigo dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
>
> ***Wendigo Psychosis (1/Day).*** When a humanoid is released from the wendigo's *wind walk* or fails its saving throw against the wendigo's *dream* spell, the wendigo can use a bonus action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be **cursed with Wendigo Psychosis**. A cursed creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, losing 1d4 Wisdom on each failed save, down to a minimum of 1 Wisdom. The reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. If the curse reduces the creature's Wisdom to 1, the creature becomes crazed and seeks an individual of its race to kill and devour. After completing this act, the cursed creature transforms into a wendigo after 2d6 minutes. Only a *wish* spell or killing the wendigo and casting *true resurrection* on the body can restore it to life. If it successfully saves against the effect three times, the curse ends and the creature becomes immune to Wendigo Psychosis for 24 hours. The curse can also be removed by the *remove curse* spell or other magic.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The wendigo makes two Claw attacks and one Bite attack.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 ($2d6 + 6$) Slashing damage plus 3 ($1d6$) Cold damage (Total 16 damage).
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 ($2d8 + 6$) Piercing damage plus 7 ($2d6$) Cold damage (Total 22 damage). If the target is a Large or smaller creature it is **grappled** (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the wendigo can't use its bite on another target.
>
> ***Howl (3/Day).*** The wendigo emits a forlorn howl. Each time it howls before finishing a long rest, the howl is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the wendigo and able to hear the howl must make a saving throw.
>
> - **First Howl.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is **frightened** for 1 minute. A **frightened** creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> - **Second Howl.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is **frightened** for 1 minute. A **frightened** creature is **paralyzed** and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> - **Third Howl.** Each creature makes a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 ($4d10$) Psychic damage and uses its reaction to make an attack against a random creature other than itself. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

## Customization Traits

You can customize a wendigo by giving it one or more of the following traits:

* ***Corner of the Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the wendigo chooses a creature it can see to stalk. While *wind walking* within 120 feet of the target, it always seems to lurk just at the corner of the target's field of vision. The target has disadvantage on all Wisdom checks as long as the wendigo stalks it. The wendigo can only stalk one creature at a time.
* ***Maddening Whispers (1/Day).*** As a bonus action while *wind walking*, the wendigo whispers maddening thoughts at one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. Only the target can hear the insane whispers and invitations of the wendigo. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against the wendigo's spell save DC or its Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction to an ability score lasts until it is removed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.
* ***Mimicry.*** The wendigo can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. The wendigo must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the wendigo's Charisma (Deception) check.

## Wendigo's Lair
### Lair Actions
On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the wendigo can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* The wendigo creates a blizzard in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot radius cylinder centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. The effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. The blizzard lightly obscures every creature and object in the area for the duration. A creature that enters the blizzard for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is **blinded** until initiative count 20 on the next round.
* A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the wendigo. Each creature within 120 feet of the wendigo must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 ($1d10$) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
* The wendigo seals one entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid ice for 1 minute or until the wendigo creates this effect again. Each 10-foot section of ice has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.

### Regional Effects
The region containing the wendigo's lair is warped by its magic, creating the following effects:

* Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the wendigo's lair.
* Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the wendigo's lair, forming blizzard conditions without warning. A blizzard occurs once every 2d12 hours and lasts 1d3 hours. During a storm, creatures moving overland travel at half normal speed, and normal visibility is reduced to 30 feet.
* Beasts within 6 miles of the lair become violent and crazed with hunger, even docile creatures.
* If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

If the wendigo dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
