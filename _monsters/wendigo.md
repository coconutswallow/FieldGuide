description: |
  The **Wendigo** is a being of ancient evil, an opportunistic hunter and evil spirit that preys on explorers and hunters in desolate, isolated places like high passes or forlorn tundra. It warps the tattered corpse of a victim into an imagined representative of its own twisted desires, typically a grotesque, rabid animal-like form with bloodstained claws and matted fur.
  
  Wendigos haunt the minds of mortals, driving them to desperation and, ultimately, cannibalistic madness. They stalk prey for days, plaguing their journeys with nightmares and foul weather before striking. They constantly experience intense hunger pangs, only temporarily relieved by feasting on creatures that know fear, especially humanoids.
  
  #### Wendigo Psychosis
  A wendigo spirit only possesses a living host after the creature has been afflicted with **Wendigo Psychosis**, an insanity-inducing curse. This curse causes the victim to slowly lose its grasp on right and wrong, eventually inspiring them to succumb to terrible hunger and feast upon their own kind. The moment they complete this act, the victim is fully inhabited by a wendigo spirit, their legs burning away, transforming them into a new Wendigo. Only a *wish* spell or killing the wendigo and casting *true resurrection* on the body can restore the original victim to life.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  A wendigo in combat uses its extreme speed (**fly 120 ft.**) to strike and swiftly retreat out of sight, relying on its **Regeneration** to quickly recover. It uses **Howl** to crowd control groups of prey, aiming to bite and **grapple** a victim before using its **Innate Spellcasting** (*wind walk*) to strand the target far from safety. It has a strong **Aversion of Fire** and will avoid or dispose of fire sources in its lair first.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aversion of Fire.*** If the wendigo takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The wendigo's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). The wendigo can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
> * **At will:** *wind walk*\*
> * **1/day each:** *control weather*, *dream* (nightmare only)
>
> \*The wendigo casts and transforms as an action. It can only target itself and up to one **grappled** creature, which is considered willing for the spell and becomes solid again if the grapple ends.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The wendigo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The wendigo regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the wendigo takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the wendigo's next turn. The wendigo dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
>
> ***Wendigo Psychosis (1/Day).*** When a humanoid is released from the wendigo's *wind walk* or fails its saving throw against the wendigo's *dream* spell, the wendigo can use a bonus action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be **cursed with Wendigo Psychosis**. A cursed creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, losing 1d4 Wisdom on each failed save, down to a minimum of 1 Wisdom. The reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. If the curse reduces the creature's Wisdom to 1, the creature becomes crazed and seeks an individual of its race to kill and devour. After completing this act, the cursed creature transforms into a wendigo after 2d6 minutes. Only a *wish* spell or killing the wendigo and casting *true resurrection* on the body can restore it to life. If it successfully saves against the effect three times, the curse ends and the creature becomes immune to Wendigo Psychosis for 24 hours. The curse can also be removed by the *remove curse* spell or other magic.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The wendigo makes two Claw attacks and one Bite attack.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 ($2d6 + 6$) Slashing damage plus 3 ($1d6$) Cold damage (Total 16 damage).
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 ($2d8 + 6$) Piercing damage plus 7 ($2d6$) Cold damage (Total 22 damage). If the target is a Large or smaller creature it is **grappled** (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the wendigo can't use its bite on another target.
>
> ***Howl (3/Day).*** The wendigo emits a forlorn howl. Each time it howls before finishing a long rest, the howl is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the wendigo and able to hear the howl must make a saving throw.
>
> - **First Howl.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is **frightened** for 1 minute. A **frightened** creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> - **Second Howl.** Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is **frightened** for 1 minute. A **frightened** creature is **paralyzed** and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> - **Third Howl.** Each creature makes a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 ($4d10$) Psychic damage and uses its reaction to make an attack against a random creature other than itself. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

## Customization Traits

You can customize a wendigo by giving it one or more of the following traits:

* ***Corner of the Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the wendigo chooses a creature it can see to stalk. While *wind walking* within 120 feet of the target, it always seems to lurk just at the corner of the target's field of vision. The target has disadvantage on all Wisdom checks as long as the wendigo stalks it. The wendigo can only stalk one creature at a time.
* ***Maddening Whispers (1/Day).*** As a bonus action while *wind walking*, the wendigo whispers maddening thoughts at one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. Only the target can hear the insane whispers and invitations of the wendigo. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against the wendigo's spell save DC or its Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction to an ability score lasts until it is removed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.
* ***Mimicry.*** The wendigo can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. The wendigo must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the wendigo's Charisma (Deception) check.

## Wendigo's Lair
### Lair Actions
On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the wendigo can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* The wendigo creates a blizzard in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot radius cylinder centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. The effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. The blizzard lightly obscures every creature and object in the area for the duration. A creature that enters the blizzard for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is **blinded** until initiative count 20 on the next round.
* A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the wendigo. Each creature within 120 feet of the wendigo must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 ($1d10$) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
* The wendigo seals one entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid ice for 1 minute or until the wendigo creates this effect again. Each 10-foot section of ice has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.

### Regional Effects
The region containing the wendigo's lair is warped by its magic, creating the following effects:

* Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the wendigo's lair.
* Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the wendigo's lair, forming blizzard conditions without warning. A blizzard occurs once every 2d12 hours and lasts 1d3 hours. During a storm, creatures moving overland travel at half normal speed, and normal visibility is reduced to 30 feet.
* Beasts within 6 miles of the lair become violent and crazed with hunger, even docile creatures.
* If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

If the wendigo dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
