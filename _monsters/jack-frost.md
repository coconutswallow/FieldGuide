  Jack frosts are fey spirits of ice and cold who play dangerous games with the lives of mortals that wander into their territory. Cruel and capricious, they take great joy in the cold, frigid death of others, and will play elaborate games with the lives of those passing through their lands. Lurking near mountain tops or in arctic terrain, they delight in tormenting helpless creatures and subsist on the body heat they drain from victims.

  #### Deadly Shapechangers
  Jack frosts possess multiple forms and can change between them at will. They may appear as a flurry of beautiful, intricately patterned snowflakes, a vaporous white cloud, or as small, pale blue fey with silver eyes and icicle-like hair. Even in the harshest snowstorms, they wear only gauzy white clothing and go barefoot. Regardless of form, their mischievous smiles and beguiling nature conceal their malice.

  #### Chilling Predators
  In their snowflake forms, jack frosts are mesmerizingly beautiful—so much so that travelers often stand entranced beneath their swirling descent. Once close enough, they transform into clouds of freezing vapor, sweeping over victims to sap their warmth. When the prey weakens, they assume their true forms to deliver chilling touches or freezing bites. Each touch sends searing cold through the victim’s veins, paralyzing and numbing flesh. Those left untreated soon succumb to frostbite and decay.

  #### Arctic Wanderers
  Jack frosts wander the frozen wastes seeking both sustenance and amusement. They live for their cruel games, toying with mortals as they drain their heat. With alien minds and twisted logic, they see torment as play—each death another victory in their endless winter games.

  #### Unusual Ecology
  Jack frosts have no sexes and reproduce by melting and reforming into two separate beings. They scatter treasure from past victims to lure new prey into their icy domains. Beyond their cruel games, they have no use for wealth or material possessions.

  #### Frostbite
  This disease affects a creature bitten by a jack frost, in which symptoms occur 1d4 hours after infection and involves gangrene setting into a bitten body part. Before the symptoms occur, the infected creature must be tended to by gentle warming lasting for at least 10 minutes, or by spells or effects that remove disease. If not treated, the infected creature gains a Lingering Injury and the disease is then removed.

  ### Combat Tactics
  The jack frost is an agile creature that should be played as a malicious troublemaker that can make life miserable for the party. When engaging in combat, the jack frost should use its flight speed and flyby to weave in and out of range when making attacks, and make use of its spells from range.
  
  The jack frost should never touch the ground if it can help it nor end its turn directly next to a creature if possible. If any characters are heavily armoured or heavy hitters, ensure that the jack frost avoids coming into direct contact with them, stays flying at least 20 feet above the ground, and engages with softer targets. Any creatures that can deal fire damage should be prioritized, and any creature that manages to reach the jack frost in melee should be given the Cold Shoulder.

  #### Ambush Tactics
  With a Stealth of +8, a jack frost should be very difficult to spot as it can easily camouflage itself up near clouds in its mist form (passive perception DC 23 to spot). Even if spotted, the party would only see a cloud of dazzling snowflakes in the air.
  
  If the jack frost has managed to sneak up on the party in mist form without any of them noticing, it should cast hypnotic pattern to catch as many surprised party members as possible. Any creatures that are not caught in the effect should then be prioritised and finished off
  
  #### Engaging Tactics
  The jack frost won't survive long against a well-equipped party, so its abilities need to be used to outmanoeuvre and deal with the most challenging party members. Even though a jack frost is not a genius, it is still intelligent and malicious enough to know how to make the use of its abilities.
  
  If the party is either clustered, caught in a place with little to no room to move, or on difficult terrain (such as ice or deep snow), the jack frost should use its Polar Midnight to catch as many creatures as possible. With Polar Midnight active, the party should be struggling to see if they have no magical light sources or darkvision, and they should be taking damage each turn they remain inside. Any creatures that are sheathed in ice can be ignored unless they have fire damage or threatening abilities. Once Polar Midnight is active, the jack frost should then keep to the air and engage with softer targets. Cone of Cold can be used with Polar Midnight active, causing high damage to the party if they are still clustered together. If the party moves well outside of Polar Midnight (and the jack frost cannot catch any more by moving it), Wall of Ice should be used to split off members of the party.

  Trapping either casters or the heavy hitters behind the wall can allow the jack frost to engage against its highest priority targets. If the jack frost isn't concentrating on Polar Midnight or one of its big spells, it should use its heat metal on any armoured characters.
  
  The jack frost's regeneration should be made use of as much as possible by making it use hit and run tactics. Always assume that a jack frost is fighting at a disadvantage against a party of adventurers. If a fight isn't going well, a jack frost should retreat by dashing well away and breaking line of sight. After all, it can heal up and always engage a wounded party later on if they encounter other threats. If it has managed to land frostbite on a party member, the jack frost should then try to pursue the party at a distance and prevent them from treating it with heat properly.

  #### Terrain
  The jack frost works best in terrain that is difficult for the party, such as deep snow, ice, or even blizzards. The party should be fearful of being set upon by roaming monsters in such dangerous situations, which makes the job much easier for the jack frost.
  
  Caves are also hunting grounds for jack frosts, for they can hide in the shadows and trap creatures with their Polar Midnight or wall of ice, and retreat to cover that breaks line of sight.

  #### Minions and Allies
  Jack frosts typically hang around in groups, called flurries, to show off their maliciousness to each other, and they work best when they are not alone. A jack frost hunts with its kin against more powerful foes, or it could be acting alone by using the wilderness and other creatures against the party. Packs of roaming winter wolves, yeti, remorhaz, or other arctic threats can easily become more dangerous if a jack frost decides to fly by.
  
  Alternatively, the jack frost can be paired with other creatures that it could efficiently work with (or deceive) such as Frost Giants, Bheur Hags or White Dragons. When paired with these monsters, the jack frost can be played as an insightful manipulator that is assisting the other creature in survival or cruelty.
  
  A Frost Giant Jarl with a Jack Frost advisor can make for a terrifying villainous duo in the mountains, especially if the party is trying to make peace with giants. After all, a jack frost thrives on its cruelty onto others and having its machinations undermine the party's efforts is what it lives for.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Extinguishing Aura.*** At the start of each of the jack frost’s turns, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) cold damage, and nonmagical light sources within 60 feet are snuffed out. A creature also takes 7 (2d6) cold damage if it touches the jack frost or hits it with a melee attack while within 10 feet.  
>
> ***Flyby.*** The jack frost doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.  
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The jack frost’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> **At will:** *fog cloud, frost fingers, heat metal (cold), ray of frost (11th level, two beams)*  
> **1/day each:** *cone of cold, ice storm, wall of ice*  
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The jack frost has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The jack frost regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If it takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. It dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.  
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** In a cold region, the jack frost can use its action to polymorph into a Medium cloud of mist or revert to its true form.  
> While in mist form, it appears as a shimmering cloud of snowflakes, can only use its *Touch* or *Hypnotizing Pattern* actions, and cannot speak or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 60 ft., can hover, and can enter other creatures’ spaces. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and is immune to all nonmagical damage.  
>
> ***Unearthly Grace.*** The jack frost’s AC includes its Charisma bonus.  
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The jack frost makes two attacks: one with its *Touch* and one with its *Bite*, or two *Icicle Spear* attacks.  
>
> ***Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 5) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.  
>
> ***Bite (Fey Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract frostbite. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by the cold damage taken, and the jack frost regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.  
>
> ***Icicle Spear (Fey Form Only).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.  
>
> ***Hypnotizing Pattern (Mist Form Only).*** The jack frost casts *hypnotic pattern* (save DC 17) centered on itself.  
>
> ***Polar Midnight (1/Day).*** The jack frost plunges an area within 60 feet into arctic darkness. A 30-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness spreads around corners and lasts up to 1 minute (concentration as if on a spell). A creature that starts its turn in or enters the area takes 14 (4d6) cold damage. A creature ending its turn there becomes encased in ice unless immune to cold damage.  
> While encased, it is restrained and cannot breathe. It must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, becoming petrified after failing three saves. The ice can be destroyed (AC 5, 20 HP, vulnerable to fire damage). A creature killed or petrified this way becomes solid ice and can only be restored by *true resurrection* or *wish*.  
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Cold Shoulder.*** When the jack frost takes damage from a creature it can see within 10 feet, it forces that creature to succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the start of its next turn.
