  Jack frosts are fey spirits of ice and cold who play dangerous games with the lives of mortals that wander into their territory. Cruel and capricious, they take great joy in the cold, frigid death of others, and will play elaborate games with the lives of those passing through their lands. Lurking near mountain tops or in arctic terrain, they delight in tormenting helpless creatures and subsist on the body heat they drain from victims.

  #### Deadly Shapechangers
  Jack frosts possess multiple forms and can change between them at will. They may appear as a flurry of beautiful, intricately patterned snowflakes, a vaporous white cloud, or as small, pale blue fey with silver eyes and icicle-like hair. Even in the harshest snowstorms, they wear only gauzy white clothing and go barefoot. Regardless of form, their mischievous smiles and beguiling nature conceal their malice.

  #### Chilling Predators
  In their snowflake forms, jack frosts are mesmerizingly beautiful—so much so that travelers often stand entranced beneath their swirling descent. Once close enough, they transform into clouds of freezing vapor, sweeping over victims to sap their warmth. When the prey weakens, they assume their true forms to deliver chilling touches or freezing bites. Each touch sends searing cold through the victim’s veins, paralyzing and numbing flesh. Those left untreated soon succumb to frostbite and decay.

  #### Arctic Wanderers
  Jack frosts wander the frozen wastes seeking both sustenance and amusement. They live for their cruel games, toying with mortals as they drain their heat. With alien minds and twisted logic, they see torment as play—each death another victory in their endless winter games.

  #### Unusual Ecology
  Jack frosts have no sexes and reproduce by melting and reforming into two separate beings. They scatter treasure from past victims to lure new prey into their icy domains. Beyond their cruel games, they have no use for wealth or material possessions.

  #### Frostbite
  A victim bitten by a jack frost must be tended to by gentle warmth within 1d4 hours or risk gangrene and permanent injury. If untreated, the creature gains a lingering injury as the infected flesh freezes and dies.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Extinguishing Aura.*** At the start of each of the jack frost’s turns, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) cold damage, and nonmagical light sources within 60 feet are snuffed out. A creature also takes 7 (2d6) cold damage if it touches the jack frost or hits it with a melee attack while within 10 feet.  
>
> ***Flyby.*** The jack frost doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.  
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The jack frost’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> **At will:** *fog cloud, frost fingers, heat metal (cold), ray of frost (11th level, two beams)*  
> **1/day each:** *cone of cold, ice storm, wall of ice*  
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The jack frost has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The jack frost regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If it takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. It dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.  
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** In a cold region, the jack frost can use its action to polymorph into a Medium cloud of mist or revert to its true form.  
> While in mist form, it appears as a shimmering cloud of snowflakes, can only use its *Touch* or *Hypnotizing Pattern* actions, and cannot speak or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 60 ft., can hover, and can enter other creatures’ spaces. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and is immune to all nonmagical damage.  
>
> ***Unearthly Grace.*** The jack frost’s AC includes its Charisma bonus.  
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The jack frost makes two attacks: one with its *Touch* and one with its *Bite*, or two *Icicle Spear* attacks.  
>
> ***Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 5) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.  
>
> ***Bite (Fey Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract frostbite. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by the cold damage taken, and the jack frost regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.  
>
> ***Icicle Spear (Fey Form Only).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.  
>
> ***Hypnotizing Pattern (Mist Form Only).*** The jack frost casts *hypnotic pattern* (save DC 17) centered on itself.  
>
> ***Polar Midnight (1/Day).*** The jack frost plunges an area within 60 feet into arctic darkness. A 30-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness spreads around corners and lasts up to 1 minute (concentration as if on a spell). A creature that starts its turn in or enters the area takes 14 (4d6) cold damage. A creature ending its turn there becomes encased in ice unless immune to cold damage.  
> While encased, it is restrained and cannot breathe. It must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, becoming petrified after failing three saves. The ice can be destroyed (AC 5, 20 HP, vulnerable to fire damage). A creature killed or petrified this way becomes solid ice and can only be restored by *true resurrection* or *wish*.  
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Cold Shoulder.*** When the jack frost takes damage from a creature it can see within 10 feet, it forces that creature to succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the start of its next turn.
