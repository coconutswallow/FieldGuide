> ### Traits
>
> ***Full Of Water.*** The drowned soul has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
>
> ***Shower of Gore.*** When the drowned soul dies, it explodes in a shower of gore. Each creature within 10 ft. of the drowned soul must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 ($2d4$) necrotic damage and become **blinded** until the end of its next turn, or half as much damage on a successful save. Undead automatically succeed this save and instead gain 5 ($2d4$) temporary hit points.
>
> ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the drowned soul to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned soul drops to 1 hit point instead.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +3, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 ($1d6 + 1$) Bludgeoning damage.
