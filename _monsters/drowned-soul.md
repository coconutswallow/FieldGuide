description: |
  A tragic and terrifying undead creature, the Drowned Soul is the lingering, spiteful remnant of someone who met a violent or agonizing end in the water. Bloated, saturated with brine, and driven by a final, desperate act of violence, it seeks to drag others down to share its fate.
  
  #### Habitat
  Drowned Souls are typically found near any large body of water—deep rivers, dark lakes, or coastal areas—where a drowning tragedy occurred. They often lie submerged beneath the murky surface, waiting for any living creature to draw near.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Drowned Soul is a basic melee threat, relying on its high Constitution and **Undead Fortitude** to keep fighting after seemingly being defeated. Its most dangerous feature is its death: it tries to close on as many foes as possible to maximize the effect of its **Shower of Gore**, which can blind and damage enemies, providing an opening for other nearby threats.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Full Of Water.*** The drowned soul has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
>
> ***Shower of Gore.*** When the drowned soul dies, it explodes in a shower of gore. Each creature within 10 ft. of the drowned soul must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 ($2d4$) necrotic damage and become **blinded** until the end of its next turn, or half as much damage on a successful save. Undead automatically succeed this save and instead gain 5 ($2d4$) temporary hit points.
>
> ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the drowned soul to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned soul drops to 1 hit point instead.
