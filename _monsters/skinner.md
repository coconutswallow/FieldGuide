description: |
  The **Skinner**, or **Fleshworm**, is a wretched, colossal monstrosity rumored to have been created during the fall of the city of Corsil as an act of retribution. Its body is a grotesque, bloated, slug-like form layered in sheet after sheet of flayed and carefully stretched dead flesh. The true body beneath is shielded by this **Mass of Flesh**, which carries the vacant facial imprints of its victims.
  
  The Skinner is the guardian, ruler, and keeper of its tomb-like lair, wandering its prison and crypt ever seeking more flesh to add to its body. Its wretched existence is a beacon for negative energy, animating nearby dead and establishing the Skinner as a **Barrow Lord** that commands a loyal force of deathless guardians.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Skinner is an intelligent commander who carefully prepares its battlefield, always encountered with its undead minions. It opens combat by using **Gaze of Fear** (Legendary Action) to isolate vulnerable targets. Its primary strategy is to use its **Paralyzing Gaze** trait to immobilize frightened victims, then slowly approach to deliver a critical hit with **Flensing Touch**. This devastating attack is used to collect skin—its compulsive collection—and instantly kill and half the target's hit point maximum. If its **Mass of Flesh** barrier is defeated or it is exposed to acid, it will flee, commanding its undead to overwhelm its pursuers while it escapes to safety.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The Skinner has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Mass of Flesh.*** The Skinner has a barrier of dead flesh with 90 hit points. If the Skinner would take damage, the barrier takes it instead. If the barrier is reduced to 0 hit points, the Skinner takes any remaining damage. The barrier has **vulnerability to acid damage**. When the Skinner reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a critical hit from its Flensing Touch, the barrier regains 30 hit points, up to its maximum of 90 hit points.
>
> ***Paralyzing Gaze.*** The horrifying presence of the Skinner freezes its prey in fear. When a creature that is **frightened** of the Skinner and that can see it starts its turn within 60 feet of the Skinner, it is **paralyzed** for as long as the creature can see the Skinner and is **frightened** of it. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid this effect at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the Skinner until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the Skinner in the meantime while **frightened** of it, it is immediately **paralyzed**.
>
> ***Turning Defiance.*** Undead within 30 feet of the Skinner have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Crush.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +9, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 ($3d8 + 5$) Bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Flensing Touch.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +9, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 ($3d6 + 5$) Slashing damage. If the attack is a critical hit, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the Skinner flays the target, tearing off the target's skin. The target drops to 0 hit points and its hit point maximum is **halved**, and the target succeeds on all subsequent saving throws against Flensing Touch. This effect can be removed by *regenerate* or similar effects that restore missing limbs or organs. On a successful save, the target takes 14 ($4d6$) Slashing damage.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
>
> The Skinner can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Skinner regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> ***Crush.*** The Skinner uses its Crush attack.
>
> ***Move.*** The Skinner moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
>
> ***Gaze of Fear (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Skinner directs its gaze. Each creature of The Skinner's choice in a 60-foot cone originating from it must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become **frightened** for one minute, repeating the save at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success. Creatures of non-evil alignment make this save at disadvantage.
