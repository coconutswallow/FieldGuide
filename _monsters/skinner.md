  the first Skinner, or Fleshworm, is rumored to have been created as an act of retribution sometime in the year 1303 during the fall of Thar. The city of Corsil, faced with destruction by ogres was converted by the last of its defenders into a vengeance dungeon. Locking themselves away behind the walls of their city, the citizens of Corsil became something else. Something wretched. A great evil laired in the sunken ruins of Corsil: Skinner. The guardian, ruler, and keeper of Skinner's Tomb, once the magnificent city of Corsil wanders the halls of its prison and crypt, ever seeking more flesh to add to its body, as under its rule, the dead of Corsil maintain their lasting vigil.
  
  *"Skinner, Skinner! He’ll eat your heads and tear off your skin! He’ll pluck out your eyeballs and devour your kin! Skinner, Skinner! Run while you can! Your flesh will be taken with a touch of his hand! Hide in the darkness, hide in the light. Fighting is useless; Skinner is fright. He takes our hides and hides our bones And makes this place our very last home. Skinner, Skinner, never open his door. Or soon your bones will lie on this floor."*

  #### Ruined Domains
  Skinners or Fleshworms prefer to reside within crypts or ruins, seeking out flesh, flaying it from the living to add it to their distended bodies. As wretched as they are physically, Skinners wrong the world itself with their very existence. The tortured existence and method of their collection acts as a beacon for negative energy. The misery and horror they leave in their wake, along with the corpses act as a channel for negative energy to corrupt the very plane around where they reside.

  #### Barrow Lord
  Occupying the decaying bones of civilization, a Skinner has a handy supply of the dead. Its presence encourages and draws negative energy to gather, animating the dead. As the undead rise, a Skinner can enforce its will upon it, creating a loyal force of the deathless to obey it and defend the location of its residence. A Skinner is not selective with the undead that rise in its wake, however it does not tolerate the presence of competing greater undead. When not distracted with allure of fresh skin, a Skinner carefully culls its flock of undead of any that might oppose it.

  #### Flayed Flesh
  A Skinner can tear the flesh from a creature with a single touch, adding it to their body as a compulsive collection, and protection. The true body of a Skinner is layered beneath sheet after sheet of peeled and stripped skin, carefully stretched over its form. The skin remains fresh and supple, but without feeling. A Skinner is at risk from acid, which would quickly consume through the various layers of flesh lining its body.

  #### Bloated Bodies
  A Skinner's form has the appearance of a massive bloated slug-like body that reared upright.  It is layered and congealed, in dead skin and flesh that ripples and twists. It is yellowed in places, fleshy pink in others, sometimes flecked with blood, but mainly white. The skin carries the general features of the recent victims, making the imprints of their empty and vacant faces that appear on a Skinner's body. A Skinner has no head truly, but rather a sunken face lacking a nose, ears, or hair. Its eyes are sunken sockets filled with a crimson mouth and is mouth a gaping, empty void. A Skinner does not have legs, but it has two massive arms, with hands wide enough to curl around most humanoids, with long, almost delicate fingers of slick white flesh. Exposed along the palms, raw, red flesh can be seen underneath.

  #### Maddened Minds
  When a Skinner adds flesh to its body, rumor has it that it steals a figment of the victim's mind. Survivors claim that simply being near a Skinner, they could hear the voices of their friends and other victims of the Skinner whispering, echoing in their minds, begging them to join them, whispering of all twisted wants that the Skinner has, a chorus of maddened voices. Despite this however, a Skinner is quite lucid and aware, acting more as a general or commander for the rest of its lair's guardians.

  #### Paralyzing Fear
  Legend has it that a Skinner's gaze can turn blood to ice and minds to rot. While legends grow with telling, there is truth to the power of a Skinner's gaze. To be seen by it is to unlock some primal animal fear. Those without the will to resist find themselves frozen with fright, unable to move or resist as Skinner slowly crawls its way toward them, reaching out with one raw, red palm for a single, last caress. Despite this however, the true skin of a Skinner is sought after by many artificers, being a vital component for frightening effects, such as wands of fear or maces of terror.
  
  #### Tactics
  A Skinner is an intelligent creature, picking its battles carefully and preparing the battlefield to its benefit. It acts as a commander and leader to the forces of undead that it keeps in its thrall. A Skinner in its lair is almost always encountered with its undead minions to assist and protect it.
  
  A Skinner will make use of its Gaze of Fear, isolating those most vulnerable to its terrifying gaze, and relieving them of their skin with its Flensing Touch. Skinners, when given the option, are focused entirely on adding to its collection of skin. Once a creature has been relieved of it, it prefers to move on to the next victim. However, if a victim is particularly resilient, returning to the fight to combat the Skinner once more, the Skinner has no qualms with killing the creature once and for all.
  
  As rulers of a domain, Skinners are territorial. A Skinner will clearly demarcate a boundary to itself as the range of its rule. While easily provoked with the temptation of fresh skin to add to its body, a Skinner typically will remain in the bounds of its lair, rarely preferring to roam.
  
  When faced with either acid or with its barrier defeated, a Skinner will prefer to flee, ordering the undead under its control to overwhelm its pursuers and buy it time to escape to safety where it may isolate a target, and quickly begin rebuilding the coating of flesh around its form.
  
  When facing creatures immune to the paralyzing effect of its frightening gaze, a Skinner will prefer to crush the creature into unconsciousness before relieving the victim of its skin through the use of its Flensing Touch.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The Skinner has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Mass of Flesh.*** The Skinner has a barrier of dead flesh with 90 hit points. If the Skinner would take damage, the barrier takes it instead. If the barrier is reduced to 0 hit points, the Skinner takes any remaining damage. The barrier has **vulnerability to acid damage**. When the Skinner reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a critical hit from its Flensing Touch, the barrier regains 30 hit points, up to its maximum of 90 hit points.
>
> ***Paralyzing Gaze.*** The horrifying presence of the Skinner freezes its prey in fear. When a creature that is **frightened** of the Skinner and that can see it starts its turn within 60 feet of the Skinner, it is **paralyzed** for as long as the creature can see the Skinner and is **frightened** of it. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid this effect at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the Skinner until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the Skinner in the meantime while **frightened** of it, it is immediately **paralyzed**.

If the attack is a critical hit, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the Skinner flays the target, tearing off the target's skin. The target drops to 0 hit points and its hit point maximum is **halved**, and the target succeeds on all subsequent saving throws against Flensing Touch. This effect can be removed by *regenerate* or similar effects that restore missing limbs or organs. On a successful save, the target takes 14 ($4d6$) Slashing damage.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
>
> The Skinner can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Skinner regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Each creature of The Skinner's choice in a 60-foot cone originating from it must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become **frightened** for one minute, repeating the save at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success. Creatures of non-evil alignment make this save at disadvantage.
