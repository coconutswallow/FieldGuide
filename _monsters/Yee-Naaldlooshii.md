description: |
  In the Druidic language, **yee naaldlooshii** translates to "he who goes on all fours.” They are more commonly known as **Skinwalkers**, the twisted reflections of druids who sought access to the highest levels of magic through the most nefarious and darkest means: sacrificing a loved one to the powers of the Shadowfell. They are the embodiment of corruption and unnatural decay, performing perverse ceremonies and manipulating natural magic for evil.
  
  Yee Naaldlooshii are relentless and cunning hunters, capable of taking the form of any number of beasts or hybrid creatures. They use **Mimicry** and **Shapechanger** to lure unsuspecting victims, often taking on the identity of a common traveler or a member of an adventuring party. Their true form is a corrupted reflection of their previous humanoid appearance, often accompanied by the stench of death.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  A **Yee Naaldlooshii** uses **Stealth** and the *pass without trace* spell to remain hidden, seeking to **surprise** the party. It utilizes **Blood Frenzy** to press its advantage in melee, making a frenzy of **Multiattacks** (Bite and Lash) in its beast form or using its spells (*blight, erupting earth*) to deal burst damage. It uses **Charm** and its powerful **Spellcasting** (*beast bond, speak with animals*) to sow chaos and control both humanoids and animals, turning a forest into its thrall. When cornered, it uses its high AC and resistances, then leverages *entangle, fog cloud*, or *meld into stone* in combination with its **Shapechanger** ability to slip away before it can be truly defeated.

>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The yee naaldlooshii is an 8th-level spellcaster. The yee naaldlooshii's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The yee naaldlooshii has the following druid spells prepared:

>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The yee naaldlooshii throws two Javelins or makes one Bite and two Lash attacks (Beast Form Only).
>
> ***Bite (Beast Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 ($2d10 + 4$) Slashing damage.
>
> ***Javelin (Humanoid or Monstrosity Form Only).*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 ($1d6 + 4$) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Lash (Beast Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 ($2d6 + 4$) Slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become **poisoned** for 1 minute. While **poisoned** in this way, the target takes 3 ($1d6$) poison damage at the start of its turn. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ***Charm.*** The yee naaldlooshii targets one beast or humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the yee naaldlooshii, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be **charmed** by the yee naaldlooshii. The **charmed** target regards the yee naaldlooshii as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The effect lasts 24 hours (or until conditions met). A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Charm of all yee naaldlooshiis for the next 24 hours.
