  The Bone Golem is a towering, fearsome construct animated by dark magic and built from the skeletal remains of countless creatures. It is relentless, serving the will of its creator without question.

  Bone Golems are typically found guarding tombs, fortresses, or laboratories where their creators reside, or in areas permeated by potent necromantic energy.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The golem will immediately seek to **imprison** a dangerous foe with its **Bone Prison** before closing in to deliver crushing **Slam** attacks. Its **Necrotic Absorption** makes it a specialized terror against enemies using necrotic energy.
