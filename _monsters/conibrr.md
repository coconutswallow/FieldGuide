description: |
  The **Conibrr** is a sapient coniferous tree, a dark reflection of a treant, awakened by malevolent entities in the cold forests of northern FaerÃ»n. Unlike typical treants, the Conibrr cares far more for destruction than preservation.
  
  #### Twisted Relatives
  * It lacks eyes, mouths, or faces, and is unable to speak, hear, read, or write.
  * It understands the languages of those who awoke it, but can only be communicated with via telepathy, which it does not possess naturally.
  * It does not care for the forest or life in general, and will gladly attack nearby wildlife.
  * The sap of a conibrr is a caustic acid, coating its bark and needles.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  * The Conibrr relies on its **False Appearance** to ambush creatures.
  * It will not attack a creature it believes to be much stronger unless in self-defense, relying on camouflage.
  * Melee attackers suffer continuous damage from its **Acidic Sap**.
  * It uses **Rock** for high ranged damage and its **Eject Needles** reaction upon taking slashing damage to punish attackers.
  * Its most powerful action, **Acid Spray**, is only available after it has been significantly damaged by slashing or fire attacks.
