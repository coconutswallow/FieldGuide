description: |
  Ember Drakes are aggressive, fire-breathing dragons found in volcanic regions and geothermal caves. Their scales glow with inner heat, and they leave scorched earth in their wake.
  
  #### Habitat
  These drakes make their lairs in areas of intense heat such as volcanic caverns, lava tubes, and the heart of active volcanoes.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  Ember Drakes rely on their Heated Body trait to punish melee attackers while using their mobility to strafe enemies with Fire Breath attacks.
