    **Pain and Porcelain**
    The Dollmaker is a creature of unnatural origin, corrupted by the energies of the Far Realm and the evil darkness of the Shadowfell. It takes on a harmless form, often that of a small child, and lures victims in. Once it has established a relationship, it drains their life essence, and places what remains of the soul into a porcelain figure that it conjures to its clawed hand. The dolls that it creates are then sold to local villages and small towns, where they attach themselves to a small child or other vulnerable individual. Over time, they form a bond with the child, turning them against their parents. They convince the child to do dark things, such as conjure demons or bring harm to innocents. It provides guidance on these matters. After the bond has been solidified, the doll brings the child to *The dollmaker*, where they will be turned into a doll themselves.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Ambusher.*** In the first round of a combat, the dollmaker has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The dollmaker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magic effects.
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** The dollmaker can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dollmaker makes three attacks.
>
> ***Claw (True Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 ($1d6 + 2$) Slashing damage, plus 7 ($2d6$) Necrotic damage.
>
> ***Create Doll.*** The dollmaker takes the life essence of a creature that died to its Life Drain attack, and moves its soul into a new *Cursed Doll* (see *Cursed Porcelain Doll* or *Cursed Porcelain Doll Swarm* for statistics). This effect can be reversed with a *greater restoration* spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
>
> ***Life Drain.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 ($2d8 + 2$) Necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Frightening Gaze.*** If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the dollmaker while he is in his true form and the two of them can see each other, the dollmaker can force the creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw if the dollmaker isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is **frightened** of the dollmaker for one minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to this dollmaker's gaze for 1 hour.
>
