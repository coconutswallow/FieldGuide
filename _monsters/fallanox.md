description: |
  The Fallanox is a repulsive, two-headed monstrosity that resembles an enormous, bloated spider. Driven by primal hunger, it uses potent paralyzing venom and deceptive tactics to ambush and consume prey. Its two heads grant it exceptional awareness and resilience.
  
  #### Habitat
  Fallanox are typically found in dark, secluded environments such as ruins, deep forest canopies, caves, or abandoned structures where they can utilize their **Spider Climb** ability and remain undetected. They often hunt in small groups, relying on cunning and numbers.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Fallanox is a deadly ambush predator. It relies on **False Appearance** to set up the perfect attack, often appearing to be a dead, harmless spider. It uses **Pack Tactics** to gain advantage on its **Bite** attacks, prioritizing a target to paralyze with its potent venom. If combat goes poorly, its **False Death** reaction allows it to survive a killing blow and feign death, hoping to spring a surprise attack on survivors. It uses its **Web** to restrain additional targets.

> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the fallanox remains motionless, it appears to be a large dead spider and appears dead to all outward inspection and to spells.
>
> ***Pack Tactics.*** The fallanox has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the fallanox's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***Spider Climb.*** The fallanox can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
>
> ***Two Heads.*** The fallanox has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

>
> ***Web Walker.*** The fallanox ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Fallanox makes two Bite attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 ($1d8 + 4$) Piercing damage plus 9 ($2d8$) Poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** for 1 minute. The target is **paralyzed** while poisoned in this way. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points.
>
> ***Web (Recharge 6).*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +6, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is **restrained** by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***False Death (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the fallanox takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead and appears to die, unless the damage is from a critical hit.
