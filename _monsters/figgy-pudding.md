  In some homes, Midwinter is a time of feasting with family and friends, enjoying each other's warmth and distracting themselves from the harsh cold and hard times that remain before spring. Only after plates have been cleared and the warm ciders are in hand around the fire do they begin to tell tales of Midwinter celebrations where the guests didn't make it past dessert—where festivities were cut short by the Figgy Pudding.

  #### Boozie Ooze
  Some say the Figgy Pudding is accidentally made when the dish’s ingredients are combined in the wrong order. Others say every Figgy Pudding is a “Deadwinter” gift from Juiblex. No matter the truth, one thing is certain: once the brandy-smothered pudding is set ablaze, the ooze doubles in size and begins its own feast, consuming and flambéing every creature in its path until it's the only merrymaker left.

> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the pudding remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a warm and sticky figgy pudding.  
>
> ***Feed on Fire.*** Whenever the pudding is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead its size increases by one category. If there isn't enough room for the pudding to increase in size, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available. While the pudding is Large or bigger, it makes Strength checks and saving throws with advantage.  
> If the pudding starts its turn at Gargantuan size, the pudding releases energy in an explosion. Each creature within 30 feet of the pudding must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. The pudding's size then becomes Medium, and it expels any creatures that can no longer fit inside it.  
>
> ***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.  
>
> ***Illumination.*** The pudding sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.  
>
> ***Ooze Dome.*** The pudding takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the pudding's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the pudding can't be seen and have total cover.  
> A creature within 5 feet
