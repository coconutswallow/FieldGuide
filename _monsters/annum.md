description: |
  Annums are strange, floating aberrations spawned from the dreams of an eternally hungry beholder. Born from psychic energy, these creatures feed upon dreams, leaving behind a fog tinted by the emotions they consume. Pink mist trails from pleasant dreams, while black vapor follows the nightmares they devour.
  
  ### Eaters of Millions
  Because a beholder’s mind never truly rests, its dreams can warp into physical forms. Most of the time, such dreams spawn more beholders. In rarer cases, however, they give birth to annums—hungry dream parasites that drift silently through the night, drawn to sleeping minds. They often appear harmless or even endearing, luring creatures into slumber before feeding on their dreams.
  
  ### Raw Attraction
  Annums are drawn to the emotional intensity of dreams. Children’s dreams attract them the most, bursting with pure imagination and fear. As they feed, a thin fog forms around them—the visible manifestation of psychic essence being drained.
  
  ### Psychic Existence
  Composed almost entirely of psionic energy, annums are translucent save for their glowing red eyes. Prolonged contact with one can cause migraines, confusion, and paranoia. They are silent but ever watchful, drifting like sentient mist between the waking and dreaming worlds.
