  #### Ecology
  Chultan Gutworms are said to have originally been a species of parasite that infested small invertebrates, inhabiting the husks of the host and piloting it back to the nest where an endless supply of hosts awaited. In the presence of the Death Curse, a new subspecies emerged. This parasite preyed upon humanoid hosts by virtue of being larger and more aggressive organisms.
  
  #### Mythology
  There are rumors of even larger hosts being infested by dozens of gutworms, perhaps explaining the presence of great zombified beasts in the Chultan jungles. Similar tales mention survivors of the lost tribe of Eshowe, utilizing the gutworms in necromantic rituals with the aim of granting everlasting life, or as some would tell it, a state of intelligent undeath where host and parasite work as one in service of the Nightsinger.
  
  #### Note
  Chultan gutworms are likely to surprise a party adventuring through Chult's jungle, given its Natural Camouflage trait, and multiple gutworms ambushing a surprised adventuring party can be devastating between its Paralytic Stinger and Infest. It is also possible that an encounter with undead in Chult could turn into an unexpected fight, with gutworms bursting out of the corpse!

> ### Traits
>
> ***Natural Camouflage.*** While the Chultan Gutworm remains motionless in muddy terrain, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary tree root.
>
> ***Parasitic Undeath.*** The victims of chultan gutworms become animated. When a corpse animated in this fashion is destroyed, it releases any gutworms currently infesting it.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Paralytic Stinger.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 ($1d6 + 3$) Piercing damage and 7 ($2d6$) Poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is **paralyzed**. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.
>
> ***Infest.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 ($4d8 + 3$) Necrotic damage. If the target is a Medium or larger humanoid or beast that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, it dies and is **infested** by the Chultan Gutworm. The Gutworm climbs inside the victim's abdomen, benefiting from total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. Unless the Chultan Gutworm is destroyed, the corpse animates after being dead for 1d4 hours. The gutworm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, immunity to **blinded** and **poisoned**, and the host creature's type changes to **undead**. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The Chultan Gutworm is destroyed if the creature is raised from the dead before it can animate, or if the corpse is targeted by a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic before it animates.
