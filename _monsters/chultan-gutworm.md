description: |
  The **Chultan Gutworm** is a giant parasitic grub that burrows through the swampy earth of Chult. Its body is covered in tough, mud-like natural armor, and it possesses a venomous stinger used to paralyze victims before it can crawl inside them.

  Chultan Gutworms are said to have originally been a species of parasite that infested small invertebrates, inhabiting the husks of the host and piloting it back to the nest. In the presence of the Death Curse, a new subspecies emerged, preying upon humanoid hosts by virtue of being larger and more aggressive organisms. Its most terrifying ability is its **Parasitic Undeath**, transforming its dead host into a mindless undead puppet.
  
  #### Note on Encounters
  Chultan gutworms are likely to surprise a party adventuring through Chult's jungle, given its **Natural Camouflage** trait. Multiple gutworms ambushing a surprised adventuring party can be devastating between its **Paralytic Stinger** and **Infest** abilities. It is also possible that an encounter with undead in Chult could turn into an unexpected fight, with gutworms bursting out of the corpse!
  
  #### Habitat
  These repulsive creatures are native to the deep, muddy jungles and swamps of Chult, particularly where the foliage is dense and the ground is soft enough for burrowing. They often lie in wait, perfectly camouflaged as tree roots in the mud.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Gutworm's strategy is to quickly incapacitate a living host. It uses **Paralytic Stinger** to inject venom and restrain a creature. Once a target is **paralyzed** (or otherwise helpless), the Gutworm focuses its **Infest** attack, delivering massive necrotic damage. If this damage kills a Medium or larger humanoid or beast, the Gutworm immediately climbs inside the corpse to animate it, effectively gaining a new, stronger body.

  ### Mythology
There are rumors of even larger hosts being infested by dozens of gutworms, perhaps explaining the presence of great zombified beasts in the Chultan jungles. Similar tales mention survivors of the lost tribe of Eshowe, utilizing the gutworms in necromantic rituals with the aim of granting everlasting life, or as some would tell it, a state of intelligent undeath where host and parasite work as one in service of the Nightsinger.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Natural Camouflage.*** While the Chultan Gutworm remains motionless in muddy terrain, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary tree root.
>
> ***Parasitic Undeath.*** The victims of chultan gutworms become animated. When a corpse animated in this fashion is destroyed, it releases any gutworms currently infesting it.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Paralytic Stinger.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 ($1d6 + 3$) Piercing damage and 7 ($2d6$) Poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be **poisoned** for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is **paralyzed**. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.
>
> ***Infest.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 ($4d8 + 3$) Necrotic damage. If the target is a Medium or larger humanoid or beast that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, it dies and is **infested** by the Chultan Gutworm. The Gutworm climbs inside the victim's abdomen, benefiting from total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. Unless the Chultan Gutworm is destroyed, the corpse animates after being dead for 1d4 hours. The gutworm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, immunity to **blinded** and **poisoned**, and the host creature's type changes to **undead**. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The Chultan Gutworm is destroyed if the creature is raised from the dead before it can animate, or if the corpse is targeted by a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic before it animates.
