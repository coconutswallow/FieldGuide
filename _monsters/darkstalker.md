description: |
  The **Dark Stalker** is an evil, massive arachnid-like being that has a hatred for the sun, tending to stick to the shadows, lying in wait for unsuspecting prey to walk by. Dark stalkers are drawn to other evil beings of greater power and are often used as assassins by their "master."
  
  A Dark Stalker will **stalk** its target for at least a day before making an attempt on the target's life. Their preferred method of ambushing is to lure their target deep into a cave while hiding on the ceiling using **Spider Climb**. When the target passes under it, the Dark Stalker drops down, cutting off an escape, and begins attacking immediately.
  
  #### Note on Combat
  Dark Stalkers are ambush predators and will seek to stalk targets for as long as it needs to, aiming to surprise the adventuring party at the opportune time. It is likely to make full use of the environment to its advantage both before and during combat, hiding in the shadows via its **Shadow Stealth** or skittering out of sight with its **Spider Climb**.

  #### Habitat
  They typically hide in caves, ancient ruins, and other lightless places, moving only under the cover of night. They are often found in the deep Underdark or subterranean lairs.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Dark Stalker uses **Shadow Stealth** to gain surprise, then leverages **Ambush** on the first round of combat for advantage on its initial attacks. It initiates with **Frightful Presence** to crowd-control the battlefield, followed by its **Multiattack** which delivers two powerful **Claw** strikes, each dealing massive poison damage. Its most devastating tool is **Night's Breath**, which can deal massive poison damage in a cone and potentially put creatures to sleep, leaving them helpless for a follow-up attack. Its **Magic Resistance** makes it difficult to neutralize with spells.

>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dark stalker's choice that is within 60 feet of the dark stalker and aware of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become **frightened** for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dark stalker's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Night's Breath (Recharge 6).*** The dark stalker exhales poison gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 ($9d6$) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more falls into a magical **sleep**, falling **unconscious** for 1d4 hours. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
