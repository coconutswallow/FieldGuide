description: |
  The **Awakened Midwinter Tree** is a construct created by the green hag Grincheuse. Every Midwinter, Grincheuse decorates spruce trees with beautiful, tempting ornaments and a bright **Blinding Star** before awakening them and sending them out to capture villagers, notably children. Their beautiful appearance is a lure, as their true purpose is to ensnare and deliver victims to their cruel creator.
  
  The tree's magic allows it to use its strands of garland to restrain prey and its star to travel more easily in darker environments. Grincheuse is said to use the trees out of pure cruelty to ruin the villagers' happiness during the cold season.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The main goal of the tree is to capture and return its victims to its creator. It will:
  
  1.  Target the easiest Medium or smaller prey to grapple and drag away.
  2.  Use its **Multiattack** to hit the target twice with **Garland Swipe** and then use **Engulf** if both attacks hit.
  3.  Once a creature is captured, it will attempt to flee back to its creator's location.
  4.  It will use its **Winter Balls** attack to spread glass in its wake, creating difficult terrain to make it more difficult for opponents to chase after it.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Blinding Star.*** When a creature that can see the tree's star starts its turn within 30 feet of the tree, the tree can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the tree isn't **incapacitated** and can see the creature. If the creature fails the save it is **blinded** until the end of its next turn. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the tree until the start of its next turn. If the creature looks at the tree in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the tree remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The tree makes two **Garland Swipe** attacks and one **Winter Balls** attack. If both **Garland Swipe** attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is **grappled** (escape DC 14), and the tree uses its **Engulf** on it.
>
> ***Garland Swipe.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 ($3d6 + 4$) Bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Winter Balls.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +5, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 ($2d6 + 2$) Piercing damage. On a hit, the area within 5 ft. of the target becomes difficult terrain and any creature ending its turn in it takes 3 ($1d6$) piercing damage.
>
> ***Engulf.*** The tree engulfs a Medium or smaller creature **grappled** by it. The engulfed target is **blinded**, **restrained**, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the tree's turns or take 13 ($2d8 + 4$) bludgeoning damage. If the tree moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The tree can have only one creature engulfed at a time. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the tree.
