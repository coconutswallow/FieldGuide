description: |
  The **Cookie Spooder** is a bizarre and benevolent arachnid with a body composed of living, edible cookie dough. Its primary purpose is to be a selfless source of comfort and sustenance, magically growing chocolate chips on its body that function as *goodberries*. Despite its monstrous appearance, it is a kind-hearted creature willing to sacrifice its own life for the survival of its friends.
  
  #### Habitat
  Cookie Spooders are found in warm, secure, and comfortable environments, such as cozy homes, kitchens, or bakeries, where they can be near those who might need their unique healing abilities.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Cookie Spooder is not a combatant; its primary role is support. It uses its daily castings of **Innate Spellcasting** (*goodberry*) to maximize the chocolate chips on its **Cookie Body** (up to 10), providing small bursts of healing to allies who can grab the chips as an action. Its final act of sacrifice is to allow a creature to eat it, instantly healing the creature based on the number of chips remaining on its body. It uses **Spider Climb** to remain out of the immediate fray.

>
> ***Cookie Body.*** After it casts *goodberry*, it grows a chocolate chip on its body up to a maximum of 10. A creature can use its action to grab one *goodberry* from the cookie spooder's body and eat it. A creature can also use its action to grab and eat the cookie spooder. The cookie spooder can crawl into a willing creature's mouth to be eaten. A creature that eats the cookie spooder in this way regains a number of hit points equal to the number of chocolate chips on the cookie spooder's body. This kills the cookie spooder.
