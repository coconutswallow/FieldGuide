> ***Spellcasting.*** The channeler is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The channeler has the following Wizard spells prepared:
> * 1st level (4 slots): *Magic Missile, Ice Knife, Cause Fear, False Life*

> ***Trident.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) Piercing damage, or 12 (2d8 + 3) Piercing damage if wielded with two hands. The attack deals an additional 2 (1d4) damage if the channeler has used Battle Dance.
>
> ***Battle Dance (Recharge 5-6).*** The channeler does a battle dance causing power to radiate from the channeler in an aura with a 30-foot radius, awakening boldness in its allies. Until the channeler loses concentration as if it was concentrating on a spell, the aura moves with the channeler, centered on the channeler. While in the aura, each non-hostile creature in the aura (including the channeler) deals an extra 1d4 damage when it hits with a weapon attack.

> ### Reactions

> ***Misty Escape.*** As a reaction when the channeler takes damage, they can use the *Misty Step* spell, spending a spell slot as normal, and gain resistance to the triggering attack.
