title: Greater Mimic
cr: 8
type: Medium Monstrosity (Shapechanger), Neutral
category: 1 Hawthorne Homebrew

description: |
  A Greater Mimic is an exceptionally large and cunning variant of the classic monster, capable of taking on the form of massive objects—or even combinations of objects—to lure in more formidable prey. It is distinguished by a large, gaping mouth that acts as an **Extradimensional Storage** space, a deadly trap into which it deposits its unfortunate victims and treasure alike.
  
  #### Habitat
  Greater Mimics typically inhabit well-trafficked but neglected areas, such as the deepest parts of ancient dungeons, forgotten bank vaults, or the holds of derelict ships. Their size and intelligence allow them to take on highly specific and valuable disguises, like a large suit of armor, a treasure chest stacked high with goods, or a merchant's cart.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Greater Mimic relies entirely on **False Appearance** and its **Adhesive** trait to secure its first target. It uses its **Multiattack** to unleash its full array of weapons, including a deadly **Bite** attack that deals acid damage and an **Assorted Weapons** attack that suggests it can quickly shift its appendages into different forms. Once a target is grappled, its **Grappler** trait ensures it hits with superior accuracy until the victim can escape its sticky grasp.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Adhesive (Object Form Only).*** The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also **grappled** by it (escape DC 16). Ability Checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
>
> ***Extradimensional Storage.*** The mimic's mouth has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter wide and 4 feet deep. This space can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. A creature can use a bonus action to retrieve an item from this space.
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** The mimic can use its action to polymorph into an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
>
> ***False Appearance (Object Form Only).*** While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
>
> ***Grappler.*** The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature **grappled** by it.
