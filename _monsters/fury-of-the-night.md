description: |
  A Fury of the Night is a horrifying, predatory monstrosity that glides through the darkness, an apex hunter defined by its raw power and terrifying presence. It is a large, winged beast whose skin and wings blend seamlessly with the shadows, making it nearly invisible against the night sky.
  
  #### Habitat
  Furies of the Night haunt dark, desolate regions, often dwelling in high mountain peaks, stormy cloud layers, or deep forests where perpetual twilight reigns. They are rarely seen near civilization, preferring to strike at remote camps and isolated travelers.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Fury is an expert aerial combatant, using **Flyby** and **Shadow Stealth** (often moving at half speed to gain advantage on Stealth checks due to **Chameleon Skin**) to set up an ambush. It initiates combat with **Frightful Presence** to scatter and control foes. Its signature move is to use **Claw** to grapple one or two targets, then use its superior strength (**Powerful Wings**) to fly them up and slam them into other creatures (**Creature Slam**) or the ground (**Divebomb**), ending the grapple and dealing massive bludgeoning damage.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Flyby.*** The Fury doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
>
> ***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the Fury can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
>
> ***Powerful Wings.*** The Fury ignores movement penalties from grappling or restraining another creature while flying.
>
> ***Chameleon Skin and Silent Wings.*** The Fury has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while moving at half speed.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Fury can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two melee attacks (Claw or Wing Slam).
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 ($2d8 + 4$) Slashing damage, and the target is **grappled** (escape DC 16). A Small or smaller creature is also **restrained** until this grapple ends. The Fury has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target. If the Fury moves out of reach of another creature, that creature can use its reaction to attempt to break the grapple on one creature grappled by the Fury by making a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.
>
> ***Wing Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 ($5d8 + 4$) Bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Creature Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 10 ft. The Fury uses a grappled creature as a bludgeon and strikes a creature within 10 ft. of them. *Hit:* The target and the grappled creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving save. *Failure:* They are **knocked prone** and take 17 ($3d8 + 4$) Bludgeoning damage. *Success:* They take half damage and are not knocked prone.
>
> ***Divebomb.*** The Fury uses its action and its movement to slam one or two creatures it is grappling into the ground. Each creature takes 3 ($1d6$) Bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet the Fury moves directly downwards on this turn. The grapple then ends. Additionally, the creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 ($3d8 + 4$) Bludgeoning damage and be **knocked prone**.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the Fury's choice that is within 120 ft. of the Fury and aware of it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or become **frightened** for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Fury's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
