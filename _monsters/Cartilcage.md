description: |
  A Cartilcage is a horrific undead entity, appearing as an animate, interlocking cage of cartilage and bone. It is an insidious creature that seeks to bind itself to living hosts, sharing damage and terrorizing its victims with unnerving sounds.
  
  #### Habitat
  Cartilcages are often found in ruins, crypts, and any location where necromantic rituals have been performed. They are patient predators, content to wait in dark corners, appearing as mere piles of scattered bones.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Cartilcage relies on its **Bind** attack to attach itself to a victim, turning the fight into a terrifying tug-of-war using its **Damage Transfer** trait. It uses its **Chatter** to frighten and control multiple foes before closing in.

> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the cartilcage remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of bones.
>
> ***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cartilcage takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.
>
> ***Rejuvenation.*** If the cartilcage is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in 1 hour unless holy water is sprinkled on its remains or a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell is cast on them.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The cartilcage makes two attacks with its Bind.
>
> ***Bind.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, the cartilcage **attaches** to it. While attached, the cartilcage can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cartilcage can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cartilcage by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
>
> ***Chatter.*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 13, each creature within 60 feet of the cartilcage that can hear its chatter and that isn't an undead. *Failure:* The creature becomes **frightened** until the end of the cartilcage's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cartilcage's chatter for the next 24 hours.
