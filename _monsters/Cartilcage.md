> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the cartilcage remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of bones.
>
> ***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cartilcage takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.
>
> ***Rejuvenation.*** If the cartilcage is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in 1 hour unless holy water is sprinkled on its remains or a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell is cast on them.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The cartilcage makes two attacks with its Bind.
>
> ***Bind.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, the cartilcage **attaches** to it. While attached, the cartilcage can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cartilcage can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cartilcage by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
>
> ***Chatter.*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 13, each creature within 60 feet of the cartilcage that can hear its chatter and that isn't an undead. *Failure:* The creature becomes **frightened** until the end of the cartilcage's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cartilcage's chatter for the next 24 hours.
