title: Autumn Gremlin
cr: 4
type: Medium Fey, Chaotic Neutral
category: Fey
description: |
  Gremlins of the Autumn Court are called upon when their masters need a creepy and crawly creature to ambush a nuisance. They are larger, stronger, and more intimidating than their smaller boggle cousins. The transformation into this creature renders them **blind**, forcing them to learn to lurk in dark caves and scurry their way through the earth, relying on their other powerful senses.
  
  #### Habitat
  These powerful fey creatures lurk primarily in natural settings such as dark caves, ruins, and areas with loose dirt or unworked stone where they can use their burrow speed and **Stone Camouflage**. They prefer environments that allow them to use their dimensional rift ability, **Scurry**, for ambush attacks.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Autumn Gremlin is a master of teleportation and environmental control. It uses **Scurry** to rapidly maneuver into position, then relies on **Gremlin Swarm** for advantage on attacks if an ally is near. Its first move is often **Dust Cloud** to **blind** opponents, followed by **Cave In** to restrain smaller targets by collapsing the ground beneath them. Its **Multiattack** allows it to deploy a mix of ranged attacks (**Dart**) and melee strikes (**Greataxe** or **Bite**).

> ### Traits
>
> ***Gremlin Swarm.*** The autumn gremlin has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one other gremlin is within 5 feet of the creature and that gremlin isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***Stone Camouflage.*** The autumn gremlin has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when in rocky terrain.
>
> ***Scurry.*** As a bonus action, the autumn gremlin can create an invisible and immobile rift provided that the rift is no bigger than 10 feet on any side and is on dirt, unworked stone or other natural terrain it can see within 5 feet of it. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the gremlin can see or specify by distance and direction. While next to the rift, the autumn gremlin can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the gremlin puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the autumn gremlin can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the gremlin's next turn.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The autumn gremlin makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Greataxe, or two with its Darts.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 ($1d4 + 3$) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Dart.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* +6, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 ($1d4 + 4$) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Greataxe.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 ($1d12 + 3$) Slashing damage.
>
> ***Cave In.*** The autumn gremlin hits the ground in front of it, causing it to collapse. A Medium or smaller creature of the autumn gremlin’s choice standing on loose earth or unworked stone within 5 feet of it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls into a hole 5 feet long on each side and 5 feet deep, taking 21 ($6d6$) bludgeoning damage, and is **restrained** by the collapsed earth on top of it. The **restrained** creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check in order to escape. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, does not fall into the hole and is not **restrained**. The autumn gremlin cannot affect a creature already under the effects of and **restrained** by Cave In.
>
> ***Dust Cloud (Recharge 5 - 6).*** The autumn gremlin kicks up loose dirt, gravel, mud, or similar terrain around it into the eyes of its opponents. Each creature within 10 feet of the autumn gremlin must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be **blinded** until the end of the autumn gremlin’s next turn.
