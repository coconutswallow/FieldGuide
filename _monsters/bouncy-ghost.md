  The Material Plane is no stranger to the appearance of a ghost; haunted, yearning creatures seeking to fulfill a last task or desire. These creatures haunt specific creatures, items, or locations, locked nearby until their final wish can be fulfilled.
  
  But in a world of magic and realms, sometimes otherworldly beings can slip through. An object carried by the wrong person at the wrong time, an entire town translocated across time and space, or, in the case of Bouncy Ghost, perhaps it was simply that poor caravan driver, with his pale skin, and constantly illness, that brought it in.
  
  The Bouncy Ghost is a creature driven of pure necessity. Unlike other ghosts, who seek to perform a task or desire before passing on, the Bouncy Ghost's only task is to not pass on at all. It is forever driven by a singular instictive desire; to return to a better life than it had when it died.
  
  Such a desire, of course, is almost always unfulfillable. An adventurer cannot simply slay a beast, or solve the ghosts murder to release the Bouncy Ghost, as the Bouncy Ghost demands nothing but life itself. One cannot revive the original corpse of the Bouncy Ghost, because it does not desire to return to the wretched state from which it passed on.
  
  So it is with this, the Bouncy Ghost forces itself into the unwilling bodies of those it can. But, its success is always short lived, for the pure malevolent energies of the Bouncy Ghost's eternal selfish ego begins to break down the unfortunate victim almost immediately. The victim finds itself trapped in their own body, aware that their words and actions are no longer their own. Their tongue twisting lies and deceit to ward off clerics and healers seeking to resolve the malady that has beset the poor victim. With this awareness, comes another realization: pain.
  
  The victim possessed by the Bouncy Ghost is fully aware that their body is beginning to reject the invader. Skin becomes loose and peels off, teeth rot and fall out, hair dries and twists until it becomes nothing more than dust. Quickly, the body's rejection causes the organs to fail, as the ghost is expelled from the now deceased host, and quickly seeks to find another to give it another brief taste of the life it so demands.
  
  It is in this manner that the Bouncy Ghost is named. Forever bouncing between hosts, struggling against its very self to find one powerful enough to survive its possession, yet forever failing. Unlike normal ghosts, there is slim chance of success to be found for the Bouncy Ghost. It will forever seek life, but bring only death.
  
  **Undead Nature**. A bouncy ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
  
  #### Note
  A Bouncy Ghost is likely to be found in an adventure already possessing another creature, possibly insinuating itself among the party under false pretenses as a friendly NPC given its high Deception score. Such a ruse however is likely to be short-lived given the Bouncy Ghost's Body Rejection trait, and it will seek out other creatures, such as those of the adventuring party, to attempt to possess once its current body expires. Given its capacity to rapidly swap between bodies if needed with its Bounce Around, a Bouncy Ghost can present a deceptively deadly challenge to an adventuring party.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Body Rejection.*** When the Bouncy Ghost is possessing a humanoid, the target takes 15 ($2d10 + 4$) necrotic damage at the end of each of the Bouncy Ghost's turns.
>
> ***Bounce Bounce.*** If the Bouncy Ghost isn't possessing a humanoid, it can use a bonus action to move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ($1d10$) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ***Undead Nature.*** A bouncy ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Bounce On Your Face.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 ($2d8 + 1$) Necrotic damage.
>
> ***Bouncy New Body.*** One humanoid that the Bouncy Ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be **possessed** by the Bouncy Ghost; the Bouncy Ghost then disappears, and the target is **incapacitated** and loses control of its body. The Bouncy Ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The Bouncy Ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, skills, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being **charmed** and **frightened**. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the Bouncy Ghost ends it as a bonus action, the Bouncy Ghost swaps bodies, or the Bouncy Ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, the Bouncy Ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this Bouncy Ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw.

> ### Reactions
>
> ***Bounce Around.*** When a humanoid hits the current body the Bouncy Ghost is possessing with a melee weapon attack, the Bouncy Ghost can force it to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be **possessed** instead.
