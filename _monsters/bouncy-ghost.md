description: |
  The **Bouncy Ghost** is a restless undead creature driven by a singular, unfulfillable instinct: to return to a better life than the one it had when it died. Unlike other ghosts, it does not seek to fulfill a task or desire to pass on; it simply demands life itself.
  
  The Bouncy Ghost forces itself into the unwilling bodies of humanoids it can, but its success is always short-lived. The pure malevolent energies of the ghostâ€™s eternal selfish ego immediately cause the host body to fail, a process called **Body Rejection**. The victim is trapped in their own body, aware that their words and actions are no longer their own, and agonizingly conscious as their skin peels, teeth rot, and organs fail. Once the host dies, the ghost is expelled and immediately seeks a new one, forever "bouncing" between hosts, demanding life, but bringing only death.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  A Bouncy Ghost is likely to be found in an adventure already possessing another creature, possibly insinuating itself among the party as a friendly NPC given its high **Deception** score. This ruse is short-lived given the ghost's **Body Rejection** trait, and it will seek out other creatures to possess once its current body expires. Its signature ability, **Bounce Around**, allows it to rapidly swap between bodies as a reaction when its current host is struck in melee, making it a highly mobile and deadly challenge that leverages the party against itself. When unpossessed, it uses **Bounce Bounce** to rapidly close the distance for a new host.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Body Rejection.*** When the Bouncy Ghost is possessing a humanoid, the target takes 15 ($2d10 + 4$) necrotic damage at the end of each of the Bouncy Ghost's turns.
>
> ***Bounce Bounce.*** If the Bouncy Ghost isn't possessing a humanoid, it can use a bonus action to move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ($1d10$) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ***Undead Nature.*** A bouncy ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Bounce On Your Face.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 ($2d8 + 1$) Necrotic damage.
>
> ***Bouncy New Body.*** One humanoid that the Bouncy Ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be **possessed** by the Bouncy Ghost; the Bouncy Ghost then disappears, and the target is **incapacitated** and loses control of its body. The Bouncy Ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The Bouncy Ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, skills, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being **charmed** and **frightened**. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the Bouncy Ghost ends it as a bonus action, the Bouncy Ghost swaps bodies, or the Bouncy Ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, the Bouncy Ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this Bouncy Ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw.

> ### Reactions
>
> ***Bounce Around.*** When a humanoid hits the current body the Bouncy Ghost is possessing with a melee weapon attack, the Bouncy Ghost can force it to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be **possessed** instead.
